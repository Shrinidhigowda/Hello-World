<h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2> 
<p><ul><li>A dog is a domestic mammal of the family Canidae and the order Carnivora.</li>
<li>Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world.</li>
<li>Many people have learned that one human year equals roughly seven dog years.</li>
<li>At three months old, dogs can receive a rabies vaccine, which is readministered every year or every three years.</li>
<li>Barking is a way for dogs to communicate with other dogs and with humans.</li>
<li>However, dogs also bark when they are bored and want attention from other dogs or from humans.</li>
<li>The companionship between humans and dogs is not a new phenomenon.</li>
<li>The next consideration is the selection of a particular type of dog.</li>
<li>No matter what kind of dog a person chooses, it is essential that it be a healthy animal.</li>
<li>The dog should appear friendly and outgoing.</li>
<li>Puppies need three basic things in order to thrive: good nutrition, warmth, and companionship.</li>
<li>There should be steady growth on a weekly basis, but there should be no excess fat around the abdomen.</li>
<li>How a dog ages is based largely on its size and breed.</li></ul></td>
